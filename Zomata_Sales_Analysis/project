📊 Zomato Sales Analysis Report
🔍 Overview
This project analyzes Zomato’s restaurant sales data across multiple dimensions to uncover key trends and provide actionable recommendations. The dataset includes orders, city-level activity, cuisine preferences, and restaurant performance, with the objective of driving strategic improvements in revenue, customer engagement, and regional operations.

🎯 Objectives
Identify top-performing restaurants and cuisines

Analyze cities contributing the highest revenue and order volume

Detect time-based sales trends and seasonal variations

Understand pricing vs quantity dynamics

Highlight gaps between order volume and revenue

❓ Key Business Questions
Which restaurants generate high order volume but low revenue?

What cities bring in the most revenue and sales?

What are the top-selling cuisines and restaurants?

How do sales and revenue trend over time?

🧠 Hypotheses
High order volume does not always translate to high revenue due to local pricing and discounting.

Specific cuisines might attract more high-value orders.

Seasonal events or campaigns may drive spikes in revenue.

📈 Key Insights
1. Sales Quantity vs Revenue
A strong correlation exists between order volume and revenue, but city-specific pricing impacts profitability.

Recommendation: Apply regional pricing models and tailored promotions to optimize revenue.

2. Sales Trends Over Time
Peak sales occurred in early 2018, followed by a decline through 2020—likely impacted by external factors like COVID-19.

Recommendation: Analyze successful historical campaigns and replicate them during strategic periods.

3. Cuisine Preferences
Italian-American cuisine leads in revenue-per-order.

Niche cuisines like Assamese-Thai and Bakery-Mexican also show strong performance.

Recommendation: Highlight premium cuisines in marketing and uplift underperformers via bundling or seasonal promotion.

4. Restaurant Performance
National chains like Domino’s, Pizza Hut, and KFC dominate.

Mid-tier restaurants show untapped growth potential.

Recommendation: Boost visibility of smaller players with in-app features and partner support programs.

5. City-Level Analysis
Electronic City (Bangalore) and Indirapuram (Delhi) are revenue hotspots.

Other cities like Bikaner have consistent sales but low growth.

Recommendation: Launch localized campaigns to support underperforming areas while doubling down on top regions.

✅ Recommendations Summary
Reinvest in top zones (e.g., Electronic City, Indirapuram) for launching new features and offers.

Target low-performance areas with localized promotions and cuisine partnerships.

Promote premium cuisines through influencer and combo deal campaigns.

Support mid-tier restaurants via enhanced visibility and training programs.

Reinstate historical strategies from peak sales periods to recapture lost momentum.

Implement dynamic, city-specific pricing models to improve balance between order volume and profit margins.

📌 Conclusion
Zomato’s restaurant sales data reveals clear geographic, seasonal, and cuisine-related patterns. By applying localized strategies, enhancing underperforming segments, and building on historical success, Zomato can drive sustainable growth and improve overall marketplace efficiency.
